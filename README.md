# CloudFront Headers Viewer
A simple website that uses a CloudFront function to display user's CloudFront HTTP headers.

To ensure lowest latency and sub-millisecond execution time, we want to use CloudFront Functions rather than CloudFront Lambda@Edge (CloudFront Functions are executed closest to the user at [CloudFront Edge Locations](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features)).

Our function will be triggered by a [viewer request event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/functions-event-structure.html#functions-event-structure-request) to collect [CloudFront HTTP headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-cloudfront-headers.html) and redirect the user to display them in the frontend client.
